# This script calculates Euler's totient phi(N) for a given RSA modulus N = p c. q, where p and q are prime numbers. It computes phi(N) = (p-1)(q-1), which is essential in RSA for determining the private key d. The challenge highlights the calculation of phi(N) as a foundational step in RSA cryptography.
